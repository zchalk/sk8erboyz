## Endless Pawsabilities

Endless Pawsabilities is an application created for users wanting to find local shelter pets. They are taken to a main page where they can type in their address then click on a cat or dog depending on what they are looking for. Search results will then come up for that type of pet closest to the user's entered zip code. The user can then favorite animals and use a name generator to generate a random name for their new pet. 

This application was created using HTML, CSS, Materialize, Javascript, jQuery, Font Awesome, the Petfinder API, and the Namey API.
